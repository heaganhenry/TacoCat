# TacoCat
Taco Cat is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase or sequence that reads the same backwards as forward. This project is a mini website and javascript coding exercise using loops and objects to checks if the phrase entered is a palindrome and display it to the user. The site also includes branding and responsive layouts as would be utilizied in a fully realized website.
